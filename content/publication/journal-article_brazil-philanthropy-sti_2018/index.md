abstract: We conducted a exploratory research on the private social investments of philanthropic nature allocated in science, technology and innovation (ST&I) in Brazil. To conduct this research, quantitative we collected and analysed data from the Group of Institutes, Foundations and Enterprises (GIFE) and the Benchmarking of Corporate Social Benchmarking of Corporate Social Investment (BISC). Our results demonstrate that the current national databases on philanthropic investments do not include indicators that measure the ST&I investments of this nature. At the same time we verified that initiatives of this kind occur in small scale in Brazil. Nevertheless, there are indications that philanthropic private social investments will become a prominent source of financing for ST&I. Therefore, our research indicates the need for further research in this topic, particularly related to the develop strategies for its allocation.
