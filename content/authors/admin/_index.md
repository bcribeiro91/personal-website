title: Beatriz Couto Ribeiro, PhD

I am Dr. Beatriz Couto Ribeiro, an Innovation Economist with a dual Ph.D. in Economics from the Technical University of Berlin (TUB) in Germany and Science and Technology Policy from the University of Campinas (UNICAMP) in Brazil. 

My areas of expertise encompass the assessment of science, technology, and innovation (STI) policies and projects in public infrastructure sectors, such as electricity, gas, water, sewage, and hydrogen. To evaluate the impact of STI policies and programs in the Global South and OECD countries on innovation outputs I employ a diverse array methodological tools including, quasi-experimental methods (e.g., Difference-in-Difference, and Synthetic Control) and qualitative methods (e.g., Interviews, and Documentary Analysis). My doctoral dissertation, for instance, assessed the role and impact of regulatory tools to foster innovation in the electricity sector.

In addition, I have experience as a consultant in projects with the energy utility CEMIG, the largest energy trader in Brazil, and Serrapilheira Institute, the first private non-profit institution geared towards fostering science in Brazil.
