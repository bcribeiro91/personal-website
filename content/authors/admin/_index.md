title: Beatriz Couto Ribeiro, PhD

I am Dr. Beatriz Couto Ribeiro, an Innovation Economist with a dual Ph.D. in Economics from the Technical University of Berlin (TUB) in Germany and Science and Technology Policy from the University of Campinas (UNICAMP) in Brazil.

My passion lies in the infrastructure domain, with a keen focus on the regulatory frameworks governing the electricity and water sanitation sectors. My professional journey in the World Bank and Lab-GEOPI â€“ Unicamp, have allowed me to work with energy utilities such CEMIG, and supported the introduction of bulk water charges, water and sanitation concession, and energy distribution in public buildings in Brazil.

I possess a robust skill set in policy and regulation analysis, employing both qualitative and quantitative methodologies. Recently, my curiosity has extended to the emerging field of hydrogen energy, where I am actively exploring its potential in Latin America.
